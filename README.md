# RTLSystem_ICS
Real Time L-System visualizer written in HTML 5

I originally designed this as a programmable turtle graphics engine with an interpreted assembly-like language and it went well until I learned about L-Systems.
I found the syntax for defining the rules of the L-System to be very simple and felt like it wouldn't be too big of a stretch to modify my turtle graphics system to work off of the L-System syntax.
The result is pretty satisfying in my opinion.
I used the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system as the basis for the interpreter so anything on that page can be easily translated.
Let me know if you find any good L-Systems or in you have any improvements.

I've listed it under the MIT license so please check that file for more information.
